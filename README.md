# JDesktop Integration Components (JDIC) 

## Introduction
The JDesktop Integration Components (JDIC) project aims to make Javaâ„¢ technology-based applications ("Java applications") first-class citizens of current desktop platforms without sacrificing platform independence.

JDIC provides Java applications with access to facilities provided by the native desktop such as the mailer, the browser, and registered document viewing applications. Additionally it provides the mechanisms by which Java applications can integrate into the native desktop such as registering Java applications as document viewers on the desktop, creating tray icons on the desktop and creating installer packages.

JDIC consists of a collection of Java packages (JDIC API), all with the package name prefix org.jdesktop.jdic, and a JNLP application packaging tool (JDIC Packager).
